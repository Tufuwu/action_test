Windows 64-bit Production Environment Installation
==================================================

These files provide a way to install the SIFT visualization tool on a Windows 64-bit system.
The following files and directories should be placed in the root directory of a USB drive
for installation to work properly:

 - Install SIFT.bat
 - create_shortcuts.py
 - rsync_sift_ahi.bat

In addition to the above the drive should contain the following in the root directory:

 - Anaconda 3.4 installer for Windows 64-bit machines
     - https://www.continuum.io/downloads
     - Tested with the installer named `Anaconda3-2.3.0-Windows-x86_64.exe` on Windows 7 laptops.
 - cwRsync
     - Version 5.4.1 x86: https://www.itefix.net/cwrsync
     - Extract zip file and rename directory to "cwrsync"

What It Does
------------

The installation script will do the following:

1. Install Anaconda3 to the C:\Anaconda3 directory and create a "sift" sub-environment.
2. Create C:\data and sets it for compression for data downloads.
3. Create C:\Users\<username>\sift_workspace and sets it for compression. This is used by the SIFT GUI.
4. Create 3 shortcuts:

    - Updated SIFT.lnk: Update the Conda package for SIFT
    - Run SIFT.lnk: Run the SIFT GUI
    - Sync AHI Data.lnk: Rsync AHI data from SSEC servers to the local computer.

How to Install
--------------

1. Run "Install SIFT.bat" from a properly configured USB drive by double clicking the icon.
2. Follow the Anaconda graphical installation using the defaults (requires admin privileges).
3. After installation has completed, press any key to close the window.
4. Run the Sync shortcut that is created on the Desktop. This will download ~250GB to
   your computer and must be run from inside the SSEC.
5. Run SIFT by double clicking the "Run SIFT.lnk" icon on the Desktop.
