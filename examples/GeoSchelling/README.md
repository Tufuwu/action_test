# GeoSchelling Segregation Model

## Summary

This is a geoversion of a simplified Schelling example. For the original implementation details please see the Mesa Schelling examples.
Instead of a regular grid it uses European NUTS-2 regions as location for majority and minority opinions.
For a region to be happy it only needs to have more similar neighbors than unsimilar ones.
