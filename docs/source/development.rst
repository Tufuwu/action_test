Development
===========

* Check out the repository.

* In the repository root, create the virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m venv venv3

* Activate the virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    source venv3/bin/activate

* Install the development dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install -e .[dev]

* We use tox for testing and packaging the distribution. Run:

.. code-block:: bash

    tox

* We also provide a set of pre-commit checks that lint and check code for formatting. Run them locally from an activated
  virtual environment with development dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./precommit.py

* The pre-commit script can also automatically format the code:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./precommit.py  --overwrite
