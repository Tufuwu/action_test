Code
====

Contributions of additional tests and code are always welcome. If in
doubt, and/or for advice on approaching a particular problem, please
contact the projects members (see section _collaboration) Before submitting code,
please review the `git repository configuration guidelines <http://github.com/autotest/autotest/wiki/GitWorkflow>`_.

To submit changes, please follow `these instructions <https://github.com/autotest/autotest/wiki/SubmissionChecklist>`_.
Please allow up to two weeks for a maintainer to pick
up and review your changes.  Though, if you'd like help at any stage, feel free to post on the mailing
lists and reference your pull request.

Docs
====

Please edit the documentation directly to correct any minor inaccuracies
or to clarify items. The preferred markup syntax is
`ReStructuredText <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_,
keeping with the conventions and style found in existing documentation.
For any graphics or diagrams, web-friendly formats should be used, such as
PNG or SVG.

Avoid using 'you', 'we', 'they', as they can be ambiguous in reference
documentation.  It works fine in conversation and e-mail, but looks weird
in reference material. Similarly, avoid using 'unnecessary', off-topic, or
extra language. For example in American English, `"Rinse and repeat" 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lather,_rinse,_repeat>`_ is a funny phrase,
but could cause problems when translated into other languages. Basically,
try to avoid anything that slows the reader down from finding facts.
